1. Bug: The two input numbers are strings and the strings are getting concatenated instead of adding the two numbers when we are using the + operator.
2. We can type cast in the function 'calculateSum'. When we are calculating the result, we typecast the num1 and num2 to be numbers. The fix is included in the directory.
